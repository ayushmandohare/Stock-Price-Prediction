# 📈 Stock Market Price Prediction using Deep Learning  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project is a **stock market price prediction system** built using **deep learning (LSTM)**.  
It fetches **real-time stock data** from Yahoo Finance, applies preprocessing, and predicts future stock prices based on historical data.  
The project also includes an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** to visualize stock trends, moving averages, and compare **actual vs predicted prices**.  
✨ Features

📊 Predict stock prices using a trained LSTM deep learning model.

🔗 Real-time stock data fetching via Yahoo Finance.

📉 Technical indicators like 50, 100, and 200-day moving averages.

🎛️ Interactive dashboard with dynamic plots to compare predicted and actual prices.

⚡ User-friendly UI built with Streamlit.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python, Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit – Development and deployment.

Keras, TensorFlow – Deep learning model (LSTM).

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn – Data preprocessing and scaling.

Matplotlib – Visualization.

yFinance API – Stock market data retrieval.
Future Improvements

Add support for multiple stock predictions simultaneously.

Improve model accuracy using hybrid deep learning models (e.g., GRU + LSTM).

Deploy the app on Streamlit Cloud / Heroku / AWS for online access.
