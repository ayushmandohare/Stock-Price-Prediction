# My-Project
📈 Stock Market Price Prediction using Deep Learning
🚀 Project Overview

This project is a stock market price prediction system built using deep learning (LSTM).
It fetches real-time stock data from Yahoo Finance, applies preprocessing, and predicts future stock prices based on historical data.
The project also includes an interactive Streamlit dashboard to visualize stock trends, moving averages, and compare actual vs predicted prices.

✨ Features

📊 Predict stock prices using a trained LSTM deep learning model.

🔗 Real-time stock data fetching via Yahoo Finance.

📉 Technical indicators like 50, 100, and 200-day moving averages.

🎛️ Interactive dashboard with dynamic plots to compare predicted and actual prices.

⚡ User-friendly UI built with Streamlit.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python, Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit – Development and deployment.

Keras, TensorFlow – Deep learning model (LSTM).

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn – Data preprocessing and scaling.

Matplotlib – Visualization.

yFinance API – Stock market data retrieval.

▶️ How to Run the Project

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-prediction-deep-learning.git
cd stock-prediction-deep-learning


Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the Streamlit app

streamlit run "Stock Prediction Model.keras.py"


Enter a stock ticker (e.g., GOOG, AAPL, MSFT) in the input box and view predictions.

📌 Future Improvements

Add support for multiple stock predictions simultaneously.

Improve model accuracy using hybrid deep learning models (e.g., GRU + LSTM).

Deploy the app on Streamlit Cloud / Heroku / AWS for online access.
