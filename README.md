# 📈 Stock Market Price Prediction using Deep Learning  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project is a **stock market price prediction system** built using **deep learning (LSTM)**.  
It fetches **real-time stock data** from Yahoo Finance, applies preprocessing, and predicts future stock prices based on historical data.  
The project also includes an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** to visualize stock trends, moving averages, and compare **actual vs predicted prices**.

## ✨ Features  
- 📊 **Predict stock prices** using a trained LSTM deep learning model.  
- 🔗 **Real-time stock data fetching** via Yahoo Finance.  
- 📉 **Technical indicators** like 50, 100, and 200-day moving averages.  
- 🎛️ **Interactive dashboard** with dynamic plots to compare predicted and actual prices.  
- ⚡ **User-friendly UI** built with Streamlit.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python, Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit** – Development and deployment.  
- **Keras, TensorFlow** – Deep learning model (LSTM).  
- **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn** – Data preprocessing and scaling.  
- **Matplotlib** – Visualization.  
- **yFinance API** – Stock market data retrieval.

📌 Future Improvements

✅ Extend to support multiple stock predictions in a single run.

✅ Enhance prediction accuracy by integrating hybrid models (LSTM + GRU, Transformers).

✅ Deploy the project on Streamlit Cloud / Heroku / AWS for global access.

✅ Add sentiment analysis from financial news/social media to improve predictions.

✅ Implement automated trading signals (Buy/Sell/Hold recommendations).
